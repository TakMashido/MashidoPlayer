remove app freeze when opening dir containing lot's of files
if trying to launch new instance of this open new tab with choosen dir/file in existing one.
open file/dir on drag'n'drop to app window
add albums creation option
add chaging playing speed option
add precise time jump option
add open dir in file system option
create launcher/installer for it
current time label near end of longer files shows time bigger then max time label. (Javafx Media bug?)
create app icon
create new open dir icon. Actual one is ugly
store all recently playied somewhere. Another Tab?
add welcome tab - version, license, creator, link to git with it itp.
create app reload method(bat?) to be able to make automatic fresh start after critical error
allow to have multiple windows with diffrend tabs
